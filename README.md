# note_taking_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple note-taking Flutter application developed using Cursor (cursor.com) and VS Code.

I asked ChatGPT to build the structure for a note-taking app in Flutter and the output has been added to the file `chatgpt_prompt.md`
