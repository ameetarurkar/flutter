# note_taking_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple note-taking Flutter application developed using Cursor (cursor.com), Claude, ChatGPT and VS Code.

I asked ChatGPT to build the structure for a note-taking app in Flutter and the output has been added to the file `chatgpt_prompt.md`

Then I pasted these instructions into Cursor. After that, I went along with all the recommendations Cursor and Claude Sonnet recommended, such as adding unit testing, features like backup and restore etc.

Lastly, the program was run in VS Code as I had issues running it in Cursor due to flutter_quill version problems.
